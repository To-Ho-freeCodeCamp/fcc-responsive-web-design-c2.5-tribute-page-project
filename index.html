        <h2> Here is a timeline of Turing's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1912</strong> - <em>Alan Mathison Turing</em> was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale, London.</li>
          <li><strong>1926</strong> - At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intellifence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.</li>
          <li><strong>1931</strong> - Alan Turing studied from 1931-1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honour student in the field of Mathematics.</li>
          <li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing studies Mathematics and Cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mecchanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> - Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>1940</strong> - Turing was responsible for creating the <em>Bombe</em> which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to ccreate their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.</li>
          <li><strong>1946</strong> - He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</li>
          <li><strong>1947</strong> - Turing lived in Hampton, London where he worked on the design of the <i>ACE (Automatic Computing Engine)</i>.</li>
          <li><strong>1948</strong> - Turing created the <i>LU decomposition method</i> that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.</li>
          <li><strong>1948</strong> - Turing was appointed a position in the mmathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.</li>
          <li><strong>1950</strong> - The <em>Turing Test</em> was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.</li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing published his masterpiece <i>"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis"</i> in January 1952</li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> - Turing was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19 years old man. He was convicted for indecency because homosexual acts were considered criminal offencces in the United Kingdom at the time. This is what lead to his downhill spiral right before his suicide.</li>
          <li><strong>1954</strong> - Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him death.</li>

        <h2>Alan Turing's famous inventions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Turing Test</strong>
            <p>Turing described an experiment which he called "The Imitation Game". It is essentially a test of a machine's measure of intelligence.</p>
          </li>
            <li><strong>Bombe</strong>
            <p>The Bomba was a codebreaking machine developed by Polish scientists in the 1930s to decipher German messages that had been coded using the Enigma machine. It was rendered useless when the Germans changed their coding procedures near the beginning of World War II. Working for the British government at Bletchley park, Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman developed the Bombe based on designs provided by the Polish. The new Bombe was an electro-mechanical device that had the great advantage of being able to adapt quickly to changes in the Germans' coding procedures. At its peak, the Bombe was deciphering 84,000 messages per month that had been coded by either the Enigma or the later, more powerful, Tunny.</p>
